# How Delivery Chat Works

## What is Delivery Chat?

Delivery Chat is a customer support chat platform that lets you add a fully customizable chat widget to your website or application. Your visitors can start conversations directly on your site, and your team manages all conversations from a centralized admin dashboard.

Think of it like having a support team available 24/7 on your website, but you control when they're available, how they look, and who can help your customers.

## Real-World Example: Nike

Let's walk through how a company like Nike would use Delivery Chat:

### Step 1: Nike Signs Up

When Nike signs up for Delivery Chat:
- They create an **Organization** called "Nike"
- They get their own subdomain: `nike.deliverychat.com` (or they can use a custom domain)
- They can start with a free plan and upgrade as they grow

### Step 2: Nike Creates Multiple Apps

Nike has different products and needs separate chat configurations:
- **Nike Shoes App** (`nike-shoes.deliverychat.com`)
  - Different business hours (9 AM - 6 PM EST)
  - Specific auto-responses for shoe inquiries
  - Custom rate limiting (100 messages/hour)
  - Brand colors matching Nike Shoes branding

- **Nike Clothes App** (`nike-clothes.deliverychat.com`)
  - Different business hours (8 AM - 8 PM EST)
  - Different auto-responses for clothing questions
  - Different rate limiting (150 messages/hour)
  - Brand colors matching Nike Clothes branding

- **Nike Accessories App** (`nike-accessories.deliverychat.com`)
  - 24/7 availability
  - Automated responses for common questions
  - Higher rate limits for high traffic
  - Custom widget position (bottom-right corner)

Each app operates independently with its own:
- Domain/subdomain
- Configuration settings
- Rate limits
- Business hours
- Auto-responses
- Widget appearance

### Step 3: Nike Adds Team Members

Nike can add team members to help manage conversations:
- Support managers who configure settings and manage conversations
- Support agents who respond to customer questions
- Each team member can be assigned to specific apps or work across all of them

### Step 4: Nike Integrates the Chat Widget

Nike can choose how to integrate the chat on their websites:

#### Option 1: Simple Iframe Embed (Nike Shoes Website)

```html
<iframe
  src="https://nike-shoes.deliverychat.com/chat?appId=NIKE_SHOES_APP_ID"
  width="400"
  height="600"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>
```

**When to use**: Quick setup, minimal customization needed, works everywhere

**Example scenario**: Nike Shoes website wants chat in a sidebar. They embed the iframe, and it automatically uses the Nike Shoes app configuration (business hours, auto-responses, branding).

#### Option 2: TypeScript SDK (Nike Mobile App)

```typescript
import { DeliveryChat } from '@delivery-chat/sdk'

const chat = new DeliveryChat({
  appId: 'NIKE_CLOTHES_APP_ID',
  apiKey: 'NIKE_CLOTHES_API_KEY',
})

// Customize widget appearance
chat.setTheme({
  primaryColor: '#FF6B35',
  position: 'bottom-right',
  logo: 'https://nike.com/logo.png'
})

// Listen to events
chat.on('message', (message) => {
  console.log('New message:', message)
})

chat.init()
```

**When to use**: Need programmatic control, custom UI, event handling, or integration with existing React/Vue apps

**Example scenario**: Nike Clothes mobile app wants to show chat as a floating button that opens a custom modal. They use the SDK to control when it appears, customize the UI, and handle events.

#### Option 3: REST API (Nike Custom Support System)

```bash
# Send a message
curl -X POST https://api.deliverychat.com/v1/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer NIKE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "appId": "NIKE_ACCESSORIES_APP_ID",
    "visitorId": "visitor_123",
    "message": "Hello, I need help with my order"
  }'

# Get conversation history
curl -X GET https://api.deliverychat.com/v1/conversations/conv_123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer NIKE_API_KEY"
```

**When to use**: Building a completely custom chat interface, server-side integration, or integrating with existing CRM/support systems

**Example scenario**: Nike Accessories has an existing support system and wants to integrate Delivery Chat's backend. They use the REST API to send/receive messages through their own UI.

### Step 5: Visitors Use the Chat

When a customer visits Nike's website:

1. **Visitor lands on nike.com/shoes**
   - The chat widget loads (using Nike Shoes app configuration)
   - Widget shows Nike Shoes branding (colors, logo)
   - If it's outside business hours (9 AM - 6 PM EST), an auto-response is shown

2. **Visitor clicks the chat widget**
   - A conversation starts
   - Visitor can type messages
   - Messages appear in real-time in Nike's admin dashboard

3. **Nike team member responds**
   - Team member sees the conversation in their dashboard
   - They respond through the admin interface
   - Visitor sees the response immediately
   - Conversation history is saved

4. **Visitor returns later**
   - Previous conversation is still available
   - Visitor can continue where they left off
   - Nike team can see full conversation history

## Key Concepts

### Organizations vs Applications

**Organization** (Nike):
- The company account
- Contains multiple applications
- Has team members
- Billing and account management

**Application** (Nike Shoes, Nike Clothes):
- A specific chat widget instance
- Has its own domain/subdomain
- Has independent configuration
- Has its own rate limits
- Can have different settings than other apps in the same organization

**Why this matters**: Nike can have one account but manage multiple chat widgets with different configurations, rate limits, and settings for different products or regions.

### Configuration Per Application

Each application (Nike Shoes, Nike Clothes, etc.) can have completely different settings:

**Widget Appearance**:
- Colors (primary, secondary, background)
- Logo
- Position (bottom-right, bottom-left, etc.)
- Size and styling

**Business Hours**:
- Nike Shoes: 9 AM - 6 PM EST, Monday-Friday
- Nike Clothes: 8 AM - 8 PM EST, Monday-Saturday
- Nike Accessories: 24/7

**Auto-Responses**:
- Nike Shoes: "Thanks for contacting Nike Shoes! We're here to help with all your shoe questions."
- Nike Clothes: "Welcome to Nike Clothes support! How can we help you today?"
- Nike Accessories: Different message for each app

**Rate Limiting**:
- Nike Shoes: 100 messages per hour (moderate traffic)
- Nike Clothes: 150 messages per hour (higher traffic)
- Nike Accessories: 500 messages per hour (very high traffic)

**Features**:
- Some apps might have file uploads enabled
- Some might have typing indicators
- Some might have read receipts
- Each app can enable/disable features independently

## Edge Cases and Examples

### Example 1: Multiple Brands Under One Organization

**Scenario**: Nike owns Converse and wants to manage both brands separately.

**Solution**: 
- Create one Organization: "Nike Inc"
- Create two Applications: "Nike" and "Converse"
- Each app has its own domain, branding, and settings
- Team can manage both from one dashboard
- Team members can be assigned to specific apps or work across both

### Example 2: Different Business Hours Per Region

**Scenario**: Nike has global operations and needs different hours for US, Europe, and Asia.

**Solution**:
- Create three Applications: "Nike US", "Nike Europe", "Nike Asia"
- Each app has different business hours matching their timezone
- Auto-responses can be in different languages
- Team members can be assigned to specific regions
- All managed from one organization account

### Example 3: Rate Limiting for High Traffic Events

**Scenario**: Nike launches a new shoe and expects 10x normal traffic.

**Solution**:
- Temporarily increase rate limits for that specific app
- Add more team members to handle the load
- Configure auto-responses for common questions
- Monitor traffic through the dashboard
- Adjust settings in real-time without affecting other apps

### Example 4: Gradual Rollout

**Scenario**: Nike wants to test chat on one product before rolling out to all products.

**Solution**:
- Start with one Application (Nike Shoes)
- Test with a small team
- Once proven, create additional apps (Nike Clothes, Nike Accessories)
- Copy successful configurations to new apps
- Scale team as needed

### Example 5: Custom Integration for Mobile App

**Scenario**: Nike's mobile app needs chat but wants it to look native, not like a web widget.

**Solution**:
- Use the TypeScript SDK instead of iframe
- Build custom UI components that match the app design
- Use SDK events to integrate with app navigation
- Maintain all Delivery Chat features (history, team management, etc.)
- Still managed through the same admin dashboard

## Data Isolation and Security

Each organization's data is completely isolated:
- Nike cannot see Adidas's conversations
- Each app's data is separate
- Team members can only access apps they're assigned to
- All data is encrypted and secure
- GDPR and compliance ready
