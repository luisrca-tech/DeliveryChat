# How Delivery Chat Works

## What is Delivery Chat?

Delivery Chat is a customer support chat platform that lets you add a fully customizable chat widget to your website or application. Your visitors can start conversations directly on your site, and your team manages all conversations from a centralized admin dashboard.

Think of it like having a support team available 24/7 on your website, but you control when they're available, how they look, and who can help your customers.

## Real-World Example: Nike

Let's walk through how a company like Nike would use Delivery Chat:

<StepByStep
  title="How Nike Uses Delivery Chat"
  steps={[
    {
      title: "Nike Signs Up",
      content: (
        <>
          <p>When Nike signs up for Delivery Chat:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>They create an <strong>Organization</strong> called "Nike"</li>
            <li>They get their own subdomain: <code>nike.deliverychat.com</code> (or they can use a custom domain)</li>
            <li>They can start with a free plan and upgrade as they grow</li>
          </ul>
        </>
      )
    },
    {
      title: "Nike Creates Multiple Apps",
      content: (
        <>
          <p>Nike has different products and needs separate chat configurations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Nike Shoes App</strong> (<code>nike-shoes.deliverychat.com</code>) - Different business hours, auto-responses, rate limiting, and brand colors</li>
            <li><strong>Nike Clothes App</strong> (<code>nike-clothes.deliverychat.com</code>) - Different business hours, auto-responses, rate limiting, and brand colors</li>
            <li><strong>Nike Accessories App</strong> (<code>nike-accessories.deliverychat.com</code>) - 24/7 availability, automated responses, higher rate limits</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Each app operates independently with its own domain/subdomain, configuration settings, rate limits, business hours, auto-responses, and widget appearance.</p>
        </>
      )
    },
    {
      title: "Nike Adds Team Members",
      content: (
        <>
          <p>Nike can add team members to help manage conversations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Support managers who configure settings and manage conversations</li>
            <li>Support agents who respond to customer questions</li>
            <li>Each team member can be assigned to specific apps or work across all of them</li>
          </ul>
        </>
      )
    },
    {
      title: "Nike Integrates the Chat Widget",
      content: (
        <>
          <p>Nike can choose how to integrate the chat on their websites (see integration options below).</p>
        </>
      )
    },
    {
      title: "Nike Integrates the Chat Widget",
      content: (
        <>
          <p>Nike can choose how to integrate the chat on their websites:</p>
        </>
      )
    }
  ]}
/>

#### Option 1: Simple Iframe Embed (Nike Shoes Website)

```html
<iframe
  src="https://nike-shoes.deliverychat.com/chat?appId=NIKE_SHOES_APP_ID"
  width="400"
  height="600"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>
```

**When to use**: Quick setup, minimal customization needed, works everywhere

**Example scenario**: Nike Shoes website wants chat in a sidebar. They embed the iframe, and it automatically uses the Nike Shoes app configuration (business hours, auto-responses, branding).

#### Option 2: TypeScript SDK (Nike Mobile App)

```typescript
import { DeliveryChat } from '@delivery-chat/sdk'

const chat = new DeliveryChat({
  appId: 'NIKE_CLOTHES_APP_ID',
  apiKey: 'NIKE_CLOTHES_API_KEY',
})

// Customize widget appearance
chat.setTheme({
  primaryColor: '#FF6B35',
  position: 'bottom-right',
  logo: 'https://nike.com/logo.png'
})

// Listen to events
chat.on('message', (message) => {
  console.log('New message:', message)
})

chat.init()
```

**When to use**: Need programmatic control, custom UI, event handling, or integration with existing React/Vue apps

**Example scenario**: Nike Clothes mobile app wants to show chat as a floating button that opens a custom modal. They use the SDK to control when it appears, customize the UI, and handle events.

#### Option 3: REST API (Nike Custom Support System)

```bash
# Send a message
curl -X POST https://api.deliverychat.com/v1/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer NIKE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "appId": "NIKE_ACCESSORIES_APP_ID",
    "visitorId": "visitor_123",
    "message": "Hello, I need help with my order"
  }'

# Get conversation history
curl -X GET https://api.deliverychat.com/v1/conversations/conv_123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer NIKE_API_KEY"
```

**When to use**: Building a completely custom chat interface, server-side integration, or integrating with existing CRM/support systems

**Example scenario**: Nike Accessories has an existing support system and wants to integrate Delivery Chat's backend. They use the REST API to send/receive messages through their own UI.

<StepByStep
  title="Visitors Use the Chat"
  steps={[
    {
      title: "Visitor lands on nike.com/shoes",
      content: (
        <ul>
          <li>The chat widget loads (using Nike Shoes app configuration)</li>
          <li>Widget shows Nike Shoes branding (colors, logo)</li>
          <li>If it's outside business hours (9 AM - 6 PM EST), an auto-response is shown</li>
        </ul>
      )
    },
    {
      title: "Visitor clicks the chat widget",
      content: (
        <ul>
          <li>A conversation starts</li>
          <li>Visitor can type messages</li>
          <li>Messages appear in real-time in Nike's admin dashboard</li>
        </ul>
      )
    },
    {
      title: "Nike team member responds",
      content: (
        <ul>
          <li>Team member sees the conversation in their dashboard</li>
          <li>They respond through the admin interface</li>
          <li>Visitor sees the response immediately</li>
          <li>Conversation history is saved</li>
        </ul>
      )
    },
    {
      title: "Visitor returns later",
      content: (
        <ul>
          <li>Previous conversation is still available</li>
          <li>Visitor can continue where they left off</li>
          <li>Nike team can see full conversation history</li>
        </ul>
      )
    }

## Key Concepts

### Organizations vs Applications

<Comparison
  title="Organizations vs Applications"
  left={{
    title: "Organization (Nike)",
    description: "The company account",
    features: [
      "Contains multiple applications",
      "Has team members",
      "Billing and account management"
    ]
  }}
  right={{
    title: "Application (Nike Shoes, Nike Clothes)",
    description: "A specific chat widget instance",
    features: [
      "Has its own domain/subdomain",
      "Has independent configuration",
      "Has its own rate limits",
      "Can have different settings than other apps in the same organization"
    ]
  }}
/>

**Why this matters**: Nike can have one account but manage multiple chat widgets with different configurations, rate limits, and settings for different products or regions.

### Configuration Per Application

Each application (Nike Shoes, Nike Clothes, etc.) can have completely different settings:

<FeatureList
  title="Widget Appearance"
  features={[
    { name: "Colors", description: "primary, secondary, background" },
    { name: "Logo" },
    { name: "Position", description: "bottom-right, bottom-left, etc." },
    { name: "Size and styling" }
  ]}
/>

<FeatureList
  title="Business Hours"
  features={[
    { name: "Nike Shoes", description: "9 AM - 6 PM EST, Monday-Friday" },
    { name: "Nike Clothes", description: "8 AM - 8 PM EST, Monday-Saturday" },
    { name: "Nike Accessories", description: "24/7" }
  ]}
/>

<FeatureList
  title="Auto-Responses"
  features={[
    { name: "Nike Shoes", description: '"Thanks for contacting Nike Shoes! We\'re here to help with all your shoe questions."' },
    { name: "Nike Clothes", description: '"Welcome to Nike Clothes support! How can we help you today?"' },
    { name: "Nike Accessories", description: "Different message for each app" }

/>

<FeatureList
  title="Rate Limiting"
  features={[
    { name: "Nike Shoes", description: "100 messages per hour (moderate traffic)" },
    { name: "Nike Clothes", description: "150 messages per hour (higher traffic)" },
    { name: "Nike Accessories", description: "500 messages per hour (very high traffic)" }
  ]}
/>

<FeatureList
  title="Features"
  features={[
    { name: "File uploads", description: "Some apps might have file uploads enabled" },
    { name: "Typing indicators", description: "Some might have typing indicators" },
    { name: "Read receipts", description: "Some might have read receipts" },
    { name: "Independent control", description: "Each app can enable/disable features independently" }

        <li>Once proven, create additional apps (Nike Clothes, Nike Accessories)</li>
        <li>Copy successful configurations to new apps</li>
        <li>Scale team as needed</li>
      </ul>
    </>
  }
/>

<ExampleCard
  title="Example 5: Custom Integration for Mobile App"
  scenario="Nike's mobile app needs chat but wants it to look native, not like a web widget."
  solution={
    <>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>Use the TypeScript SDK instead of iframe</li>
        <li>Build custom UI components that match the app design</li>
        <li>Use SDK events to integrate with app navigation</li>
        <li>Maintain all Delivery Chat features (history, team management, etc.)</li>
        <li>Still managed through the same admin dashboard</li>
      </ul>
    </>
  }
