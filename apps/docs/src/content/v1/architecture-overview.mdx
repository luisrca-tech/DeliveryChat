# Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the Delivery Chat platform architecture and how its components work together.

## System Architecture

Delivery Chat is built as a multi-tenant platform with the following key components:

### Core Components

1. **Admin Dashboard** - Management interface for administrators
2. **Web Application** - Public-facing landing page and registration
3. **Hono API** - Backend API service handling all business logic
4. **Widget** - Embedded chat widget for customer-facing applications
5. **Documentation** - This documentation platform

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

The platform uses a multi-tenant architecture where:

- Each tenant has isolated data and configuration
- Tenants can have custom domains
- Secrets and credentials are managed per tenant
- Authentication is handled through Better Auth

### Integration Points

#### Iframe Integration
- Direct embedding via iframe
- Simple and secure
- Works across all platforms

#### JavaScript SDK
- Programmatic control
- Event-driven architecture
- Customizable UI components

#### REST API
- Server-side integration
- Full control over implementation
- Suitable for custom workflows

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration** - Users register through the web application
2. **Tenant Creation** - New tenants are created with isolated resources
3. **API Key Generation** - Administrators generate API credentials
4. **Chat Integration** - Developers integrate using their preferred method
5. **Message Handling** - Messages flow through the Hono API
6. **Real-time Communication** - WebSocket connections for live chat

## Security

- All API keys are encrypted at rest
- Multi-tenant isolation ensures data separation
- Secrets management through Infisical
- Secure authentication via Better Auth

## Scalability

The platform is designed to scale horizontally:
- Stateless API design
- Database connection pooling
- Caching strategies
- Load balancing support
