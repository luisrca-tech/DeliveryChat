- Example: Small e-commerce site with occasional customer questions

**Professional Plan:**
- 200 messages per hour per application

**Enterprise Plan:**
- Custom rate limits (typically 500-1,000 messages/hour per app)

<Callout type="note">
  Rate limits can be temporarily increased for special events. Contact support for assistance.

## Visitor Limits

Monthly visitor limits are based on unique visitors who interact with your chat widget.

**What counts as a visitor:**
- A unique user who opens or interacts with your chat widget
- Counted once per month, even if they return multiple times
- Visitors who only view the widget but don't interact are not counted

**What happens if you exceed limits:**
- Starter & Professional: Chat continues to work, but you'll be notified to upgrade
- Enterprise: No limits, chat always available

## Application Limits

Each application is a separate chat widget instance with its own configuration.

**Starter (1 application):**
- One chat widget for your main website
- Example: `yourcompany.deliverychat.com`

**Professional (5 applications):**
- Multiple chat widgets for different products or regions
- Example: `product1.deliverychat.com`, `product2.deliverychat.com`, `us.deliverychat.com`, `eu.deliverychat.com`, `support.deliverychat.com`

**Enterprise (Unlimited):**
- As many applications as you need
- Perfect for large organizations with multiple brands, products, or regions
