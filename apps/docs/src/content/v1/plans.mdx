</Callout>

## Visitor Limits

Monthly visitor limits are based on unique visitors who interact with your chat widget.

**What counts as a visitor:**
- A unique user who opens or interacts with your chat widget
- Counted once per month, even if they return multiple times
- Visitors who only view the widget but don't interact are not counted

**What happens if you exceed limits:**
- Free, Basic & Premium: Chat continues to work, but you'll be notified to upgrade
- Enterprise: No limits, chat always available

## Application Limits

Each application is a separate chat widget instance with its own configuration. An application represents a chat widget that can be embedded on a specific website domain. Your organization gets one subdomain (e.g., `yourcompany.deliverychat.com`) that serves all your applications.

**Free & Basic (1 application):**
- One chat widget for your main website
- Example: Embed widget on `yourcompany.com` (connects to `yourcompany.deliverychat.com`)

**Premium (5 applications):**
- Multiple chat widgets for different products, brands, or regions
- Example: Embed widgets on `product1.com`, `product2.com`, `us.yourcompany.com`, `eu.yourcompany.com`, `support.yourcompany.com` (all connect to `yourcompany.deliverychat.com`)

**Enterprise (Unlimited):**
- As many applications as you need
- Perfect for large organizations with multiple brands, products, or regions
- Each application can be embedded on a different website domain
