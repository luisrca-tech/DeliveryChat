# Integration Overview

Delivery Chat provides multiple ways to integrate the chat support platform into your application. Choose the method that best fits your needs.

## Integration Methods

### 1. Iframe Integration

The simplest way to embed Delivery Chat is using an iframe. This method requires minimal setup and works across all platforms.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://your-domain.com/chat?appId=YOUR_APP_ID"
  width="400"
  height="600"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>
```

### 2. JavaScript SDK

For more control and customization, use our JavaScript SDK. This allows you to programmatically control the chat widget.

```javascript
import { DeliveryChat } from '@delivery-chat/sdk'

const chat = new DeliveryChat({
  appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
})

chat.init()
```

### 3. REST API

For server-side integrations or custom implementations, use our REST API to send and receive messages programmatically.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.your-domain.com/v1/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello, I need help"}'
```

## API Credentials

To get started, you'll need to generate your API credentials from the admin dashboard:

1. Log in to the admin dashboard
2. Navigate to API Settings
3. Generate a new `appId` and API key pair
4. Store these credentials securely

## Security

All API keys are encrypted and stored securely. Make sure to:
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Rotate keys regularly
- Revoke unused keys
