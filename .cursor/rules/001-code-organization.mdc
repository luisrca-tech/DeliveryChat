# Separation of Concerns (SoC)

- **Feature-Based Structure:** Group files by feature (e.g., `features/auth/`, `features/billing/`) rather than by technical type (`services/`, `components/`).
- **File Splitting:** If a file handles both UI and heavy business logic, split the logic into a separate `use[Feature].ts` hook or a `[feature].service.ts`.
- **Private Components:** Create a `components/` folder inside each feature for feature-specific UI. Only put truly universal components in the root `src/components`.
