# Frontend & UI Standards

- **Avoid useEffect:** Do not use `useEffect` for data fetching or state synchronization.
  - Use **Server State Libraries** (like TanStack Query) for API calls.
  - Use **URL Search Params** (via `nuqs` or native APIs) for UI state like filters, tabs, or modals.
- **UI Style Guide:**
  - Maintain visual consistency by following existing project patterns (border-radius, shadows, spacing).
  - Use the project's atomic UI components (Button, Input) instead of raw HTML.
- **State Management:** Keep state as local as possible. Only lift state up when shared across multiple sibling features.
