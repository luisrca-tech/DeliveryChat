# Security Guardrails

- **Sanitization:** Always sanitize and validate user input to prevent Injection attacks (SQL, XSS, Command Injection).
- **Secrets Management:** Never hardcode API keys, passwords, or secrets. Use environment variables or a secret manager.
- **Least Privilege:** When writing code that interacts with databases or external APIs, only request the minimum permissions/scopes required.
- **Dependency Safety:** Favor well-maintained, official libraries over obscure packages. Check for vulnerabilities if a tool is available.
